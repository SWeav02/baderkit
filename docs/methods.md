# Methods

BaderKit is based on the [Henkelman group's](https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/henkelman/code/bader/) excellent Fortran code.
This page provides descriptions and recommendations for when to use each method.

## Descriptions

=== "ongrid"
    
    **Key Takeaways:** Extremely fast, but prone to orientation errors
    
    This is the original algorithm proposed by Henkelman et. al. It is extremely
    fast, but prone to error. For example, it gives slightly different oxidation 
    states for different orientations of a molecule or material.
    
    For each point on the grid, the gradient is calculated for the 26 nearest 
    neighbors, and the neighbor with the steepest gradient is selected as the 
    next point in the path. This path is followed until a maximum is reached or
    a previous point in the path is hit. In the former case, all of the points in the path
    are assigned to the maximum, and in the latter they are assigned to the same
    maximum as the colliding path.

=== "neargrid (default)"

    **Key Takeaways:** More accurate than the ongrid method with comparable speed.
    Requires edge refinement.
    
    This algorithm was developed by Henkelman et. al. after the ongrid method
    to fix orientation errors. It is less accurate than the weight method, but 
    useful where it is desirable to have only one basin assignment per point on the grid.
    
    A gradient vector is calculated at each point using the three nearest neighbors. 
    A step is made to the neighboring point closest to this gradient vector. A
    correction vector pointing from the new point to the original gradient is
    calculated to preserve information about the true gradient.
    
    At each step, this correction vector is compounded. If any component of the 
    correction vector is ever closer to a neighboring point than the current one, 
    a correction is made to keep the path closer to the true gradient.
    
    After all of the points are assigned, a refinement must be made to the 
    points on the edge, as the accumulation of the gradient is technically only
    correct for the first point in the path.

=== "weight"
    
    **Key Takeaways:** Extremely accurate, but not suitable for codes relying
    on one assignment per grid point. Slower and more memory intensive.

    This method reduces errors due to orientation by allowing each point to be
    partially assigned to multiple basins, resulting in high accuracy.
    A voronoi cell is generated at each point on the grid. A "flux" is calculated 
    from this point to each neighbor sharing a voronoi facet using the difference 
    in charge density modified by the distance to the neighbor and area of the 
    shared voronoi facet. The total flux is normalized to create "weights" which
    indicate the fraction of the volume that flows to each neighbor.
    
    Moving from highest to lowest, each point is assigned to basins by assigning
    the weight going to each neighbor to that neighbors own fractional assignments.
    The ordering from highest to lowest ensures that the higher neighbors have
    already received their assignment.
    
    !!! Note
        The `bader.basin_labels` and `bader.atom_labels` properties 
        for this method are generated by assigning the points to the basin with 
        the highest weight, or the lowest basin index in the case of a tie. This
        makes the assignments very unreliable for further analysis.
